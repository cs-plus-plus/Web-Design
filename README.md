# Project: HTML/CSS Website

## Project Objective
The **HTML/CSS Personal Website** project aims to assess your proficiency in HTML and CSS, as well as your ability to create a visually appealing and responsive web page. In this project, you will develop a personal web page that reflects your creativity and showcases your skills in front-end web development.

## How to View a GitHub Repo as a Webpage Easily (Using GitHub Pages)

Follow these steps to set up GitHub Pages and view your repository as a webpage:


### 3. **View Your Webpage**
   - You can view your website by navigating to:
     ```
     https://<your-username>.github.io/project-name
     ```
   - Example: If your GitHub username is `janedoe`, visit `https://janedoe.github.io/project-name`.

### Notes:
   - GitHub Pages works for static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - The `index.html` file will serve as the homepage, and any changes you make to this file will automatically update the webpage.

## Editing Your index.html on GitHub.dev

Follow these steps to edit your `index.html` file and push your changes to GitHub:

1. Go to your GitHub repository and find the `index.html` file.
2. Click on the **pencil icon** (✏️) to edit the file.
3. In the "Open with..." dropdown, select **GitHub.dev** to open the file in a new tab or window.
4. Make the necessary changes to your `index.html` file.
5. Once you've finished editing, click on the **Source Control** icon from the menu bar on the left side (it looks like a branch).
6. In the **Source Control** panel, write a commit message describing your changes, and then click on the **Commit and Push** button to save and push your changes to GitHub.

Now your changes will be live and saved to your GitHub repository!

## Requirements

### Content:
- Create a web page containing three well-written paragraphs about yourself.

### Style Sheet:
- Link the webpage to an external style sheet named `styles.css`.

### HTML Elements:
Ensure that the webpage contains the following HTML elements:
- A title (`<h1>`)
- A sub-title (`<h2>`)
- Three paragraph titles (`<h3>`)
- Three paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Three images (one per paragraph) with wrapped text (using ID rules with `float` left or right, e.g., `#pic1`)
- Three links to external pages with CSS styling for `:link`, `:visited`, and `:hover` effects
- A `div` tag to set the width of the page (e.g., `#container`)
- Another `div` tag inside of the container (e.g., `#sidebar`, `#didYouKnow`)
- Apply at least one class rule to each paragraph (e.g., `.bold`, `.highlight`, `.underline`)
- Use appropriate CSS properties for padding, margin, borders, line height, fonts, etc.

### Media Queries:
Implement the following media queries for responsive design:
- Three `@media` queries for `max-width` breakpoints (1200px, 992px, 768px).

### Styling:
- Ensure all style changes are made through the external CSS file (`styles.css`) and not inline in the HTML.

### Design Guidelines:
- Adhere to website design best practices, such as using sans-serif fonts for readability, to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly layout.

## Helpful Tips
- Utilize CSS properties to style your webpage. Refer to resources like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for property references.
- Use tools like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) for harmonious color combinations for backgrounds, fonts, and links.
- Ensure readability by adjusting line height in paragraphs and making images fit within the layout.
- Use fixed widths for larger screens (e.g., 1100px, 800px, 700px) for the container `div`, and percentage widths for smaller screens to maintain responsiveness.
- Maintain an organized and legible layout using margins, borders, and font sizes, especially on mobile devices.
- Stack `div` elements for smaller screens by removing floats and adjusting layout for readability.
- Center the container on the page using `margin-left` and `margin-right: auto;`.
- Consider resizing or removing images for smaller screens based on the overall design.
